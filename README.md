Allows you to redirect users to other pages based on keywords entered by matching them against a pre-loaded JSON dataset of your choosing.
If mutliple entries with the same keyword exist, the first will be matched and redirected.

A sample JSON dataset has been included in this demo.

<b>Instructions:</b>

Include the "ssquery" class in the input element that will take the query of the keyword, and attach the "ssearch" class to the element to click to query the dictionary.

<b>Note:</b> Requires jQuery to function, as included in demo.
